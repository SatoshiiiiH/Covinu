# Covinu

Since March 2020, a lot has changed. We now live in a world that nobody could have foreseen many years ago. Many people, along with their families, have been put through a lot of strain and could could use a helping hand. The world of crypto has been a phenomenal ecosystem that has generated tremendous amounts of wealth for the people. It's only right we share some of that wealth others. We present to you $COVINU, a way to help others in this time of need. As we generate trade volume and increase in market capitalisation, more funds are sent to designated charities. Join us and we will show you the impact you can make, full transparency included.
